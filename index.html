        <h2>Health Insurance Price Predictor</h2>
        <p>This is built using machine learning techniques.
           The dataset was preprocessed and analyzed, and the features were engineered to achieve better accuracy. 
           The experiments demonstrated that the Gradient Boosting algorithm outperformed other algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 89.2%.
           The results indicated that the features such as age, BMI, smoking habit, and region were the most significant factors affecting medical insurance prices. 
           The proposed model can be useful in the healthcare industry for providing personalized and accurate medical insurance prices to individuals. 
           However, further research is needed to improve the model's performance by incorporating additional data sources and exploring other machine learning algorithms.</p>
