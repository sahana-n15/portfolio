        <h2>Health Insurance Price Predictor</h2>
        <p>This is built using machine learning techniques.
          The dataset was preprocessed and analyzed, and the features were engineered to achieve better accuracy.
          The experiments demonstrated that the Gradient Boosting algorithm outperformed other algorithms, achieving an
          accuracy of 89.2%.
          The results indicated that the features such as age, BMI, smoking habit, and region were the most significant
          factors affecting medical insurance prices.
          The proposed model can be useful in the healthcare industry for providing personalized and accurate medical
          insurance prices to individuals.
          However, further research is needed to improve the model's performance by incorporating additional data
          sources and exploring other machine learning algorithms.</p>

        <h2>Real Estate Price Predictor</h2>
        <p>This project is for real estate company who can use this model for predicting the house prices with given set
          of features .
          In this we have analysed the problem from collected data , imported it to Jupyter Notebook , looked for
          promising attributes ,found out correlations , plotted graph , created a pipeline and also dealt with missing
          values .
          This model is created by Supervised  learning .</p>
